\begin{frame}{Geometry Within TDKENO}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Previously used KENO V.a for flux shape
    \item Geometry described by combinations of simple shapes
    \item Now incorporates KENO-VI, generalized geometry
\end{itemize}
    $\rightarrow$ Advantage of KENO-VI, can describe complex systems exactly

\begin{frame}{Feedback Mechanism -- TREAT}


{\Large \[\rho_{fb}(t) = \sum_{i = 0}^{3}a_i Y^i (t) \] }

{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho_{fb}(t)$ is the feedback reactivity
    \item $Y^i (t)$ is the total yield in the core at time $t$
    \item $a_i$ is the empirical coefficient for a third order polynomial
    \item Fed back into the point kinetics equations
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
Coefficients come from empirical TREAT data\\
May be varied to suit other systems
